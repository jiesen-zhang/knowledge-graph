## Abstract
The aim of this project is to implement a basic knowledge graph where the nodes are entities and the relationships between nodes are the edges. Subjects and objects are entities while the predicate is the relation. This subject, predicate, object (SPO) relation is derived from the resource description framework (RDF).
